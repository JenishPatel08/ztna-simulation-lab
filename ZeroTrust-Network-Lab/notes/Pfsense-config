# pfSense Firewall Configuration Notes

- Anti-lockout rule enabled for safe admin access
- RBAC implemented using firewall rules:
    - Allow SSH only from 192.168.1.10 (admin)
    - Block SSH from all other IPs (including employee/Kali)
- Web UI and SSH services protected via LAN interface
- Firewall logs show:
    - Admin SSH: Allowed
    - Employee SSH: Blocked

ðŸ§  This proves Zero Trust enforcement using microsegmentation + least privilege.
